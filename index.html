        <h2>Software Engineering Training</h2>
        <p>While studying at <a href="https://watchandcode.com/">Watch And Code</a>, I embraced the process of learning software engineering primarily by reading open source codebases.
          The curriculum is designed to guide students from complete beginner to contributing in a meaningful way to open source projects.
          For about six months I worked as an active contributor to the
          devtools/debugger of Mozilla Firefox Web Browser.
          It was a great experience to have my code reviewed by Mozilla engineers, and to digest and contribute to
          such a massive codebase.  Tackling this modern Javascript codebase I became famaliar with React and Redux, learned to use
          Mercurial for version control, and wrote tests using Jest and Mochitest frameworks.

        <p>
          I am curently studying as a Junior Software Engineer Fellow at <a href="https://qwasar.io/">Qwasar Silicon Valley</a>
          where I have learned numerous languages and frameworks, with a focus on the fundamentals of software engineering,
          including data structures and algorithms.
          By building many small projects which piggyback each other,
          I have gained an increased understanding of larger patterns in software architecture.  There is an emphasis on peer code reviews
          (both giving and recieving), working both individually and as part of a small team,
          and helping others by making presentations about specific concepts or previously completed projects.

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        For fifteen years I enjoyed a successful career as an orchestral musician.
        I held positions playing French Horn with many orchestras around the country,
        including the Rochester and Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestras,
        Sarasota Opera Orchestra, and San Francisco Chamber Orchestra.
        I appeared regularly onstage with numerous other groups around the San Francisco Bay Area,
        across the United States and internationally.
        This included frequent performing and touring as an extra with the San Francisco Symphony,
        participating in various festival orchestras, as well as solo and chamber music engagements.
        I also held teaching positions at Centre College in Danville KY, and San Jose State University in San Jose, CA.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017 I was diagnosed with Task Specific Focal Dystonia, which effectively ended my performing career.
        I worked for one year as a professional brewer, then made the decision to immerse myself in the study of software engineering.
        I currently work as an Admin Manager for Awesome Pawsome, where I enjoy spending time with clients (human and canine) and helping
        manage the complexities of running a thriving small business in the heart of San Francisco.
        I am passionate about learning and pursuing a lifelong continuous growth mindset, and I'm eager to begin working professionally as a developer.
      </p>
      </p>
        When I'm not immersed in learning to code, I enjoy reading and movies, and have completed several marathons and two short triathlons.
